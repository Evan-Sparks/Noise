Noise
=====

A simple Noise library.  Currently implements a version of Ken Perlin's original 1983 3d noise algorithm and a 2d Worley noise algorithm, as well as means of manipulating that noise, including fractalization with configurable persistence and lacunarity.

Example outputs:

High frequency Perlin noise:
