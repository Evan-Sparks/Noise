Noise
=====

A simple Noise library.  Currently only implements a version of Ken Perlin's original 1983 3d noise algorithm as well as means of manipulating that noise, including fractalization with configurable persistence and lacunarity.

Example outputs:

Simple high frequency noise:

Fractal noise with 3 octives:

A more complex example involving the absolute value of fractal noise:

The sin of fractal noise plus a gradient in the x axis:
